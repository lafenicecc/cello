[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yeasy/cello.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/yeasy/cello)

PaaS to provide Blockchain as a Service!

Using Cello, we can 

* Obtain blockchains with customized configurations instantly, e.g., a 6-node chain using PBFT consensus.
* Maintain a pool of running blockchains healthy with no human operations. 
* Check the system status, scale the chain numbers, change resources... through a dashboard.

![Typical Scenario](docs/imgs/scenario.png)

You can also find more [scenarios](docs/scenario.md).

## Features

* Manage the lifecycle of blockchains, e.g., create/delete automatically.
* Response nearly instantly, even with hundreds of chains.
* Support customized (e.g., size, consensus) blockchains request, currently we support [hyperledger fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric).
* Support native Docker host or swarm host as the compute nodes, more supports on the way.
* Support heterogeneous architecture, e.g., Z, Power and X86, from bare-metal servers to virtual machines.
* Extend with monitor/log/health features by employing additional components.
